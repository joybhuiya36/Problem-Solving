#1st Approach
select round(avg(order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date)*100,2) as immediate_percentage
from Delivery
where (customer_id, order_date) in (
    select customer_id, min(order_date)
    from Delivery
    group by customer_id
)



#2nd Approach
with subquery as (
    select *
    from Delivery
    group by customer_id
    having min(order_date)=min(customer_pref_delivery_date)
)
select round(count(*)/(select count(distinct customer_id) from Delivery)*100,2) as immediate_percentage
from subquery
